I thought it would be useful to create a mobile reference app for other Thai learners, dedicated specifically to learning Thai vowels.

This app combines different features of the vowels such as their pronunciations, their written forms, and words that use them.

Iâ€™d love to improve the app - if you have any feedback here is our contact info: thaivowels@gmail.com .
